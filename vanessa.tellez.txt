Hey, hey, hey! I live in this example. :)

Stretch Goal Research:

 While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, 
 they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. 
 Independantly research the following topics to learn more about Git.

Research and understand what a merge conflict is and how to resolve it.
--Merge Conflicts occur when you merge branches and have conflicting commits. 
It could be that they contradict each other, someone edits a file while someone else deleted it.
You have to resolve it before making the pull request. A few ways to resolve it:
You have to manually edit and decide what commits to keep for the final merge. 
GitHun has a conflict editor that can be used when the conflict is in the same line 
of the same file. All other conflicts have to be resolved on the command line. 


Reseach the Git commands pull, rebase, merge. 
 These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push 
 to the master branch.
git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge. It fetches and downloads information from
a remote repository and updates the local one so they can match. Git fetch is considered "safer"
because it will download the remote information but not change the local repository while pull
will retrieve and apply changes to match, which could lead to conflict. 
Merge will combine multiple commits into one. 
Rebase is similar to merge, where it will bring changes from one branch to another. 
Merge is viewed more as "forward moving" while Rebase has strong history rewriting skills.

Reseach the Git commands reset , revert, clean. 
 These commands will allow you to go back and ammends previous commits you have made.
 
Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console.

Research and setup SSH keys with Github, so that you do not need to input
 your username/password each time you push.
